Reactive State-Management for JavaScript Applications\n\nA web application is a lot like an iceberg - what you see on the surface is just a tiny fraction of the complexity that lies beneath the waves. To a casual observer, it's easy to get absorbed by beautiful designs, and be amazed by how a little CSS and JavaScript can give rise to such immersive experiences. But the more complex an application becomes, the more critically it depends on a solid foundation - the nuts and bolts of component hierarchies, state management, and caching layers that hold the whole thing together.\nTwist is a library that arose in light of these problems, by focusing on application state, and how it gets bound to reusable UI components. Twist is not a UI framework in its own right, but it does provide a syntax for writing components that's compatible with other frameworks, such as React. It uses a structured reactive approach, so that you easily scale your application, while maintaining an easy way of binding to the view - you'll recognize concepts that were inspired by Mobx and Redux, which are both very popular state-management libraries for React.\nTo give you a feel for what Twist looks like, here's a small fragment of code, showing part of a model (a store), and part of a view (a component). Notice that stores can nest other stores (DOB and Address are also stores, but aren't shown):\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal name;\n    @State.byVal description;\n    @State.byRef(DOB) birthday;\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n\n    @Action CHANGE_DESCRIPTION(newDescription) {\n        this.description = newDescription;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass ProfileView {\n    @Attribute user;\n    @Observable newDescription;\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.newDescription = this.user.description;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Hello { this.user.name }!\n            \n                Happy Birthday!!\n            \n            About yourself: \n             this.user.dispatch('CHANGE_DESCRIPTION', this.newDescription) }>Save\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nThe Twist Documentation explains everything in great detail, but here's a preview of the main concepts:\n\nApplication state is placed in stores - these are serializable to/from JSON, and the @State.xxx decorators tell Twist how to serialize each property (which can itself be another store).\nStores are modified via actions - this ensures that all changes go through a single bottleneck (the \"dispatcher\"), so that you can reason about all the changes to your state. In particular, this means that Twist supports time-traveling debugging, using the Redux Devtools Extension.\nAny state that can change is marked as observable, which allows Twist to know what to update when it changes (anything marked with @State.xxx is implicitly observable).\nUI components have attributes as a means of passing in arguments, and a render function that declaratively shows how to render the component (this uses JSX syntax). When anything observable changes that the component depends on, the rendered view will be automatically updated.\n\nWhile the state portion of Twist is framework-agnostic, the implementation of components depends on which UI framework is used. Right now, Twist only supports React, via React-Twist, but it's designed so that there can be other implementations in the future (and we encourage contributions if you're interested in helping with this!). This would allow the same component to work with multiple UI frameworks, which would be great for shared component libraries! Even today, React-Twist makes it really easy to use Twist stores with React, and also adds a bunch of features on top of React to make your life easier. See here for a complete description of the features.\n\nNote: In case you're wondering, React-Twist components are React components - they just automatically optimize when to re-render, so you don't need to think about it. If you write a component in React-Twist, it can be used directly by a normal React application. Similarly, React-Twist components can use normal React components directly - everything is rendered via React and ReactDOM.\n\nUsing Twist\nIf you want to use both the state-management and component layers of Twist, you'll need to install the following (via NPM or Yarn):\n\n@twist/core - This includes support for stores, data binding, and application state management.\n@twist/react - The React implementation of Twist components.\n@twist/react-webpack-plugin - A webpack plugin that compiles Twist files (Twist has its own Babel transform that runs before React's).\n\nIf you're not using webpack, you can also get hold of the Babel configuration directly, using @twist/configuration (this is done automatically by the webpack plugin).\nAfter that, the only thing you need is a .twistrc file in the root of your project, that tells Twist which libraries to include (this is also used by the Twist ESLint plugin). There are a number of advanced options, but to get up and running, you just need to tell Twist that you're using React-Twist:\n{\n    \"libraries\": [\n        \"@twist/react\"\n    ]\n}\n\nIn your webpack.conf.js you can now include the React Twist plugin - by default this will compile all files that end in .jsx with Twist and React:\nconst ReactTwistPlugin = require('@twist/react-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    plugins: [\n        new ReactTwistPlugin(),\n        ...\n    ],\n    ...\n};\n\n"},"pages/getting-started/":{"url":"pages/getting-started/","title":"Introduction to Twist","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nIntroduction to Twist\nImportant things to know\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Twist\nTwist is a state management and container library for JavaScript. It melds some of the best ideas from both Mobx and Redux. It is inspired by Mobx's observables and mutable state, while also using Redux's concepts of stores and actions to ensure a single pipeline through which state can be mutated. The former mutability allows for an extremely fast and performant state library, while the latter ensures that state is easily managed and tracked (including with time-travelling debugging tools). Twist also approaches front end development from the state first, rather than the view layer first, as is typical with many other frameworks. Twist has bindings for React now, and the community is invited to work on bindings for other frameworks.\nTwist makes it incredibly easy to create performant, scaleable stateful applications. Twist makes it easy to:\n\nencapsulate your application state in a centralized location, outside of the views/components.\nexport/import your application state to/from JSON – this is important for persistence, and server-side rendering.\ndebug changes to the application state using the excellent Redux Devtools Extension.\n\nTwist can be used without any particular front-end framework, but Twist becomes even more powerful when combined with React using the React bindings for Twist. When combined with these bindings, it's easy to:\n\ncreate reactive components that render in response to changes in stores\nuse declarative JSX extensions to perform iterations and conditionals\nuse JSX extensions to make it easy to add styling and class changes\n\nImportant things to know\nTwist is built on modern JavaScript (ES2015 and above), and utilizes Babel to transpile the code to ES5 so that your code can run on a wide variety of browsers. As such, you should be familiar with the following ES2015+ concepts in order to effectively utilize Twist:\n\nModules (import and export)\nClasses\nArrow functions\n\nIn general, Twist tries to use standard ES2015+ features. However, there are a couple of features that Twist uses a lot that aren't yet fully standardized:\n\nDecorators\nClass Fields\n\n\nNote: Technically you can use Twist without using decorators or class fields. However, these features are extremely useful and productive, and is what we'll use in all example code.\n\n"},"pages/getting-started/installation.html":{"url":"pages/getting-started/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nInstalling Twist\n\n\nInstalling Twist\n\nNOTE: The easiest way to start using Twist is to use one of our pre-configured starter projects.

To accomplish this, Twist relies upon you to instrument your data model and stores by indicating which of your model's fields should be observed. You can then build your app to respond to changes on those fields using watches or other components that are designed to track references for you automatically.\nAn observable is a class field that has been instrumented with the @Observable decorator. This decorator will automatically create a getter and a setter to track references and changes to the field.\nBindings\nAn observable tracks references, or bindings, to observables whenever those fields are accessed. By keeping track of those accesses, it's possible to build a dependency tree during runtime. Then, should any dependency be invalidated, the other bindings can also be invalidated and then re-evaluated.\nReactivity\nWhenever a field is modified, the associated bindings are automatically invalidated and re-evaluated. When this occurs, notifications are generated which indicate that a change has occurred. You can subscribe to these notifications by using the watch method on any class that inherits from SignalDispatcher.\nNon-primitive fields\nThe @Observable decorator only works with primitive fields – that is, fields that are of a primitive type (like a number or string). In order to observe changes within an Array, Set, or Map, one must create an observable instance. Twist provides an observable wrapper for each case: ObservableArray, ObservableSet, and ObservableMap. In each case, the methods you would expect are present, although ObservableArrays are not indexed using brackets as are Arrays. Instead you can use at and setAt. For example:\n\n\n\nArray instance\nObservableArray instance\n\n\n\n\nconst x = a[1];\nconst x = a.at(1);\n\n\na[2] = x;\na.setAt(2, x);\n\n\n\n"},"pages/fundamentals/components.html":{"url":"pages/fundamentals/components.html","title":"Components","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nComponents\nA simple Twist component\nInternal State\nAttributes\nTODO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nMost modern UI frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) have the concept of components. A component, in short, is just an encapsulated bit of logic that interacts with and optionally renders a mapping of your app's state. You can combine (compose) these components together into interesting and complex user interfaces, while also gaining the benefits of modularity and reusability.\nA Twist Component looks largely the same regardless of which UI framework you're targeting. That's because Twist components implement a consistent interface across all supported frameworks. Of course, if you're only targeting React, then you can still use React-specific functionality, but if you want your Twist component to work across the supported frameworks, then you'll want to write idiomatic Twist components.\nA simple Twist component\nLet's take a quick look at what a simple Twist component would look like:\n@Component\nclass HelloWorld {\n    render() {\n        return Hello, World;\n    }\n}\n\nWe could then use this component in another component's render method like so:\n\n\nInternal State\nA Twist component can have internal state by using observables. By using observables you can react to any changes that might occur.\nLet's create a simple clock component that maintains some internal state:\n@Component()\nclass Clock {\n    @Observable date = new Date();\n\n    @Bind\n    update() {\n        this.date = new Date();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        setInterval(this.update, 1000);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return {this.date.toLocaleTimeString()};\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, note that we define our clock's internal state by using @Observable, and we're creating a new class field called date and setting it to the current date (via new Date()). By instrumenting our date as observable, we can make changes to it and trigger a fresh rendering.\nNext we create a method called update that will be responsible for updating the component's internal state. As you can see, it's really easy – we just assign a new Date instance to this.date. Because it's observable, anything that is bound to this value will be invalidated and re-evaluated.\nBut update on its own doesn't do anything – we have to trigger it somehow. The best place to do that is by using the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Once the instance is rendered in the DOM, this lifecycle method is called and we can create an interval that calls update every second.\n\nNOTE: Notice that when we defined update we prefixed it with @Bind. This is a convenience decorator that we can use to automatically bind the method to the instance. If we didn't do this, we'd have to do something like setInterval(() => this.update, 1000) to ensure that we were referring to the correct this.\n\nFinally, we render the date's time portion in the render method. This will be updated every second because update will be modifying our component's internal state every second.\nAttributes\nOn its own, a component with no public interface doesn't provide a lot of functionality. We need a way to provide data to the component, as well as a way to respond to events that the component might trigger.\nComponents expose a public interface via attributes. If you're familiar with React, this is roughly equivalent to React's props. Twist uses the term attribute because this is the same term used when building HTML elements.\nAttributes are defined by using the @Attribute decorator. These attributes are themselves observable. Let's create a timer component that will count down from a specified time.\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\n@Component\nclass Timer {\n    @Attribute(PropTypes.number) seconds = 60;\n    @Observable startTime;\n    @Observable currentTime;\n\n    get secondsRemaining() {\n        return Math.max(\n            Math.round(\n                this.seconds - (this.currentTime - this.startTime) / 1000\n            ),\n            0\n        );\n    }\n\n    @Bind\n    update() {\n        this.currentTime = performance.now();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        this.startTime = performance.now();\n        this.currentTime = this.startTime;\n        setInterval(this.update, 1000);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return {this.secondsRemaining};\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we're mixing observables with attributes. We need some internal state to track the actual elapsed time (setInterval isn't actually terribly accurate), and we also need to expose an external interface so that a consumer can pass in a specific number of seconds from which we can count down. For example:\n\n\nWe've also done something else interesting in this component: the actual seconds remaining is calculated in a getter.

But what about the application's state? Keeping state in UI components is generally a bad idea, unless that state is tightly coupled to the view - for example, it's good to store the \"checked\" state of a checkbox inside the control, but it's bad to store the details of the logged in user.\nThe great news in Twist is that all the observable primitives you've seen (@Observable, ObservableArray, ObservableMap, etc) - aren't restricted to components. They can be used anywhere in your application, to give you complete flexibility over how you structure your model. The only one that doesn't make sense outside of a component is @Attribute, because that exposes a JSX interface for setting the property - in other contexts, @Observable suffices.\nDecoupling Models from Views\nLet's say you want to create some classes to represent the data model of your application - for example, the state of the logged in user:\nclass UserData {\n    @Observable name;\n    @Observable email;\n    @Observable address;\n}\n\nThat was easy! You just instrument your classes with @Observable - any view that accesses one of these fields will now get automatically updated when it changes.\nThe next question is where to store your state? One approach would be to create a singleton that stores the state (like a global variable) that can be imported and accessed from anywhere in your app. This leads to problems if you later need to have multiple instances running at the same time - it's a lot of effort to go back and refactor all of your global state. Another approach would be to pass the state around your components using attributes, but this quickly gets messy - especially if your component hierarchy is very deep.\nTo solve this problem more cleanly, Twist has a mechanism called scopes.\nSharing State with Scopes\nIn Twist, a scope is an object that's shared by a component and all of its children. It's accessible within any component, via this.scope. At the point you attach your application to the DOM, Twist creates a global scope that gets shared by all the components you create.\nLet's take a look at an example, using scopes to share an instance of UserData throughout an application:\n@Component({fork: true})\nclass MyContainer {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.userData = new UserData();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n    render() {\n        return { this.scope.userData.name };\n    }\n}\n\nHere, MyComponent has direct access to userData because it was placed on the scope by its parent component - in both components, this.scope is the same object. \nScopes in Twist are inherited prototypically, so when you fork a scope, it means you still have read access to anything on the scope in the context where your component is used. But anything you write to the scope won't be visible outside of your component and its children. Also, when the component is disposed, its forked scope will be disposed at the same time - there's no need for you to manually clean it up. As a rule of thumb, if you're adding anything to the scope, you should be forking it!\nOne subtlety to bear in mind, is if you add an object to the scope (or anywhere else on the component) that holds resources that need to be cleaned up later. In this case, you need to dispose it when the component is disposed. Twist provides an easy shortcut for this, by using the link method on a component. You can write:\nthis.scope.userData = this.link(new UserData());\n\nThis tells Twist to call this.scope.userData.dispose() when the component is disposed - you just add a dispose method to UserData with your cleanup logic. If you have a tree of objects that all need to get disposed, it's a good idea to inherit from Disposable. This gives each class access to link, as well as a default dispose method that disposes your links (just remember to call super(); when you override dispose).\n"},"pages/fundamentals/state-containers.html":{"url":"pages/fundamentals/state-containers.html","title":"State Containers","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nState Containers\nStores\nActions\nConnecting Model and View\nStores and Two-Way Data Binding\nMutable Stores\nDerived State\nStores and Components\n\n\n\n\nState Containers\nThere are two core notions in Twist, which are borrowed from Redux: stores, and actions.\nStores\nA store is a container for state. To define a store, simply make a new class using the @Store decorator. An instance of a store has properties for storing state, just like any JavaScript object. The difference is that in a store, we need to be explicit about how to serialize/deserialize the state to/from JSON. We do this using @State.XXX decorators on each of the properties (e.g. @State.byVal, @State.byRef etc). The @State.XXX decorators automatically make the properties observable, so there's no need to add @Observable in addition.\nStores are immutable by default, meaning that you can read the @State.XXX properties via data bindings from your view, but you can't directly modify them. If you want to modify one of these properties via two-way data binding, you need to create a local getter/setter as a proxy, so that you can dispatch an action in the setter (see the section on Actions below). Alternatively, you can make the store mutable, so that this mapping to an action happens automatically (see the section on Mutable Stores).\nHere's a simple example of a store - notice that you can put one store inside another, using @State.byRef:\n@Store\nclass Address {\n    @State.byVal state;\n    @State.byNumberVal zipCode;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n}\n\nEvery store has the methods toJSON() and fromJSON() methods, for serializing the store to/from a JSON. Additionally, @Store and @State.XXX prevent the state from being modified outside of an action handler - which we'll now describe!\n\nNote: toJSON() doesn't return a JSON string, but rather a plain JavaScript that can be serialized to a string via JSON.stringify. This is to allow you to control the exact formatting (e.g. whether you want line breaks and indentation, etc).\n\nActions\nBy itself, a store is fairly useless, because it can't be modified - the @State.XXX decorators prevent you from writing something like ...user.firstName = 'Bob' directly in your code - it will throw an exception.\nTo allow state to be modified, you add actions to your store. The handler for an action is just a method, decorated with @Action - you can think of the @Action decorator as giving special permission to modify the state. Actions are invoked by calling store.dispatch() with the name of the action. Let's take a look at a simple example:\n@Store\nclass MyStore {\n\n    @State.byRef(User) user;\n\n    @Action SET_USER_TITLE(title) {\n        this.user.title = title;\n    }\n}\n\nTo invoke the SET_USER_TITLE action in the above store, you would call:\nstore.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', title)\nYou can pass any number of parameters to an action, and they get passed in as the arguments to the handler.\nWe deviate from Redux here in two important ways. Firstly, the action handler (called a reducer in Redux) is not a pure function - it mutates the state, rather than returning a new state. Secondly, we've put the logic for the actions in the store, with a separate function for each action (as opposed to a single function with a switch statement). We think this makes it a bit easier to read/write.\nAs we mentioned earlier, stores can be composed using @State.byRef. For example:\n@Store\nclass MyStore1 {\n    ...\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyStore2 {\n    ...\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyMainStore {\n    @State.byRef(MyStore1) store1;\n    @State.byRef(MyStore2) store2;\n}\n\nDispatched actions get propagated to the sub-stores, so you can easily split up your application state into different pieces. Similarly, when you call store.toJSON() or store.fromJSON(), it will recurse through the sub-stores in addition to normal state.\nBy default, dispatched actions get propagated to all sub-stores of the store you dispatch to. The handler of the parent store will get called first, followed by the handlers of sub-stores. There are two ways to prevent the action from being propagated to sub-stores:\n\nReturn true from the action handler. This indicates that the action has been handled, and doesn't need to be propagated further.\nChange @Action to @Action({propagate: false}) - this tells Twist not to propagate the action (regardless of the return value of the action handler).\n\nConnecting Model and View\nHooking up a store (your model) to the view-layer of your application is easy. The top-level component (e.g. the main entry point for your application) creates a new store, and make it accessible to the rest of the application. If you're using React-Twist, you can do this using scope, as the following simple example illustrates:\n@Component({ fork: true })\nclass MyMainView {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        // Assume we get INITIAL_STATE from the server, or from some local storage\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE);\n    }\n\n    get store() {\n        return this.scope.store;\n    }\n\n    knight() {\n        this.store.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', 'Sir');\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            { this.store.user.fullName }\n             this.knight() }>Make Knight\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nNote that when you pass in INITIAL_STATE to the store's constructor, this actually maps onto a special @@INIT action that populates the state - this ensures that all state mutations happen through actions, even initialization!\nStores and Two-Way Data Binding\nSometimes, having to dispatch actions to change the state can be a pain - it means that you can't directly bind to a value in a store, using two-way data binding, because it can't be updated outside of an action handler. For example, let's say you want to update the title in the User store, as the user is typing this into an input field, and have the store update automatically whenever the input field changes. You can still use two-way data-binding, but you need to introduce a getter and setter as a proxy, where the setter dispatches the appropriate action:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore;\n    }\n\n    get title() {\n        return this.scope.store.user.title;\n    }\n\n    set title(newTitle) {\n        this.scope.store.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', newTitle);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\nMutable Stores\nIt would be easier if you could update the store directly, and so remove the need for the getter/setter. For this reason, Twist gives you the option of creating a mutable store. You can make a store mutable by passing a mutable option to the @Store decorator, as follows:\n@Store({mutable: true})\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n}\n\nThis lets you directly modify the store, so you can use two-way data binding to update it. This simplifies the above store to the following:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\nThe important thing to remember about mutable stores is that they still use actions under the hood. When you modify the store, an action gets created for you, meaning that it goes through the parent store's middleware. This means you can still use the redux-devtools-extension with mutable stores! The following diagram illustrates what's going on under the hood:\n\nThere are four stages to this:\n\nWhen you change a mutable store, this gets converted to an action under the hood. The action name describes the property to set (or method to call), and the action payload is the value to assign to the property (or the arguments for the method).\n(green arrows) The action is routed up the store hierarchy to the top-level store, and passed through its middleware. If you're using redux-devtools-extension, you'll see an action that looks like 'storeA/storeB/@property' - this describes the path down the store hierarchy, and the property you were setting (in the case of a method, like calling store.items.push(...), it would look something like 'storeA/storeB/@items.push()').\n(red arrows) The action is routed back down to the store you changed - this is doing what's known as source routing in networking.\n(blue arrow) The implicit action gets applied to the store. Unlike a normal action, it doesn't get propagated to any child stores of the target.\n\nIn a mutable store, you can change any of the @State.XXX properties, as well as arrays and maps created by @State.byRefArray/@State.byRefMap. The only limitation is that the payload of the action (the value you set, or the arguments to the method you call) must be serializable - otherwise we wouldn't be able to record and replay the action. This means that while you can call this.items.reverse() directly, you can't call this.items.sort(sortFunction) because functions aren't serializable - you'd have to wrap it in an action.\nIf you don't specify the mutability of a store, it gets inherited from its parent. By default, stores are not mutable - but if you want to make all the stores mutable, just set the top-level store to mutable and the sub-stores will inherit this (you don't need to set mutable: true everywhere).\nNote that right now, we only allow configuring mutability at a store-level granularity - we may add support for controlling mutability on a per-property level in future.\nDerived State\nIn the store example so far, we've only added fields for the raw data. More commonly, however, we want to display data in the view that's derived from the model. If this data is generally useful (e.g. used in more than one view), it makes sense to move it to the model. This can be done simply by adding a getter:\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n\n    get fullName() {\n        return (this.title ? this.title + ' ' : '') + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\n    }\n}\n\nThere's nothing special needed here - Twist's data binding will work across the getter, so whenever the raw model data changes, anyone bound to the getter will also update.\nBut what happens if we have an expensive operation in the getter? For example, we might be filtering on an array and doing some iteration and/or array allocations. If it's a plain getter, then all data bindings that reference the getter in the application need to be re-evaluated whenever the raw state changes. That means we might be doing the same operation multiple times, which is inefficient. If this is the case, we can just mark the getter with the @Cache decorator:\n@Store\nclass MyState {\n\n    ...\n\n    @Cache\n    get myProperty() {\n        return this.expensiveComputation();\n    }\n}\n\nThis has the effect of introducing an intermediate property that watches the expression in the getter. When the state changes, the cache gets invalidated. Whenever the getter is invoked, it returns the cached value if there is one, or generates the cache. This means that if there are 10 places in the application that bind to this expression, it will only be re-evaluated once whenever the state changes.\nSince @Cache is a tradeoff - it adds to memory usage, and a bit of overhead to the getter - only use it when the computation is sufficiently expensive and/or widely used to benefit from caching.\nStores and Components\nSo far, we've described Twist from the perspective of an application, where you construct a single store for the entire application (which can be composed of other stores). In reality though, your application often consists of sub-components, some of which are not specific to your application, and may even be implemented by somebody else as a shared component.\nIf we continue with our example of the User store, let's imagine that we have a shared component that needs information about the logged-in user. If we already have a User store in our main store, then it doesn't make sense for the shared component to create another - there would be duplicate effort in populating the store (e.g. via extra network calls), and we'd have two user stores that could get out of sync with one another. So, let's pass in the store to the component:\n@Component({fork: true})\nclass UserProfileView {\n\n    @Attribute userStore;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: { this.userStore.name }\n            ...\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\n...\n\n\n\nBinding to data from the store is easy, but what about making changes to the store? You want all changes to go through the top-level store, so that it passes through a common middleware (e.g. if you're using redux-devtools-extension), but a shared components shouldn't need to know about how your application store is structured - it only cares about once small piece of the store.\nTo make life easy in cases like this, Twist lets you dispatch directly to a sub-store, and under the hood routes the action via the top-level store. The following diagram shows how this works:\n\nThere are three stages when you call dispatch on a child store:\n\n(green arrows) The action is routed up the store hierarchy to the top-level store, and passed through its middleware. If you're using redux-devtools-extension, you'll see an action that looks like 'storeA/storeB/ACTION_NAME' - this encodes the path down the store hierarchy into the action name.\n(red arrows) The action is routed back down to the store you changed - this is doing what's known as source routing in networking.\n(blue arrow) The action gets dispatched to the store. Just like if you dispatched an action to the top-level store, this gets propagated to child stores (essentially, broadcast down the tree), but only starting from the sub-store you dispatched to. Remember that you can prevent propagation by returning true in the action handler.\n\nThis makes it easy to pass stores to reusable components - they just need to agree on the interface that the store provides.\nOne thing to be careful of, is that you can't compose the same store inside of two parents. For example, the following is not allowed:\n@Store\nclass A {\n}\n\n@Store\nclass B {\n    @State.byRef(A) a;\n\n    @Action SET(a) {\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n}\n\nvar a = new A();\nvar b1 = new B();\nvar b2 = new B();\n\n// This succeeds, turning a into a sub-store of b1:\nb1.dispatch('SET', a);\n\n// This fails - since a is already a sub-store of b1, it can't also be a sub-store of b2:\nb2.dispatch('SET', a);\n\nThere are many good reasons for requiring the structure of your store hierarchy to strictly be a tree. The most obvious reasons are (a) it leads to a lot of confusing cases, like actions being handled multiple times by the same store, and not knowing which top-level store to pass actions through, and (b) links aren't preserved when you serialize to/from JSON.\n"},"pages/guides/integrating-with-redux-devtools.html":{"url":"pages/guides/integrating-with-redux-devtools.html","title":"Integrating with Redux DevTools","keywords":"","body":"TODO\n"},"pages/guides/mutability.html":{"url":"pages/guides/mutability.html","title":"Mutability","keywords":"","body":"TODO\n"},"pages/guides/asynchronous-actions.html":{"url":"pages/guides/asynchronous-actions.html","title":"Asynchronous Actions","keywords":"","body":"TODO\n"},"pages/reference/core/AbstractComponent.html":{"url":"pages/reference/core/AbstractComponent.html","title":"AbstractComponent","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nAbstract Component\nInheritance\nComponent Lifecycle\nconstructor\nrender\ncomponentWillMount\ncomponentDidMount\ncomponentWillUnMount\n\n\nComponent APIs\nComponent Features\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Component\nTwist assumes an \"abstract component\" specification that is implemented by any view layer framework bindings.

It provides a dispose() method, which can handle cleaning up of resources after the object is no longer needed, and methods for linking other disposable objects to it. Anything \"linked\" will also be disposed when the containing object is disposed.\nYou can also create your own subclasses of Disposable, as the following example shows:\nimport { Disposable } from '@twist/core';\n\nclass A extends Disposable {\n\n    dispose() {\n        super.dispose();\n        console.log('A Disposed')\n    }\n}\n\nclass B extends Disposable {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.a = this.link(new A());\n        this.link(() => console.log('Link Disposed'));\n    }\n}\n\n// The following will output to the console:\n// > A Disposed\n// > Link Disposed\nnew B().dispose();\n\nAs you can see, you can either pass a Disposable object or a function to link() - if you pass in a function, it will get called at dispose() time.\nThere's one important thing to remember - if you override dispose(), you must remember to call super.dispose() as well, otherwise the links won't get disposed!

For example, Component inherits from SignalDispatcher.\nA SignalDispatcher has a watch() method that's useful for programmatically reacting to changes on an expression. Here's an example, using a component as the instance of SignalDispatcher:\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n\n    @Observable value = 2;\n    @Observable computedValue;\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        this.watch(() => this.value, value => {\n            this.computedValue = 2 ** Number(this.value);\n        });\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Value: \n            Computed Value: { this.computedValue }\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a contrived example, because you could have just bound directly to the computation from the JSX, but sometimes you need to do something programmatically when a value changes - that's what watches are for!\nSignalDispatcher also comes with a number of methods for handling events. The basic building blocks are trigger() for triggering events, and on() and off() for registering event listeners. Here's an example:\nimport { SignalDispatcher } from '@twist/core';\n\nclass MyDispatcher extends SignalDispatcher {\n}\n\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.dispatcher = this.link(new MyDispatcher());\n    }\n\n    @Bind\n    onEvent() {\n        alert('Event Fired!')\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n             this.dispatcher.on('event', this.onEvent) }>Add Listener\n             this.dispatcher.off('event', this.onEvent) }>Remove Listener\n             this.dispatcher.trigger('event') }>Trigger Event\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nInstance Methods\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nwatch(fn, callback)\nWatch the result of evaluating fn(). Whenever the value of fn() changes, callback will be invoked with the new value.\n\n\nwatchCollection(fn, callback)\nShallow watch the collection that's the result of evaluating fn(). Whenever the collection changes, callback will be invoked with the collection.\n\n\nmultiWatch(fns, callback)\nWatch an array of values - the results of evaluating each function in fns. Whenever any of the values changes, callback will be invoked with an array containing the new values.\n\n\ndefineObservable(key, defaultValue)\nDefine a new observable property key, with a default value of defaultValue. This is equivalent to instrumenting with @Observable (i.e. @Observable key = defaultValue).\n\n\ndispose()\nSame as Disposable.dispose (see Disposable), but also stops all listeners.\n\n\ntrigger(name, ...args)\nTrigger the event name (a string) - any additional arguments are passed to the event handlers\n\n\non(name, callback)\nRegister callback as a listener for the event name.\n\n\noff(name, callback)\nUnregister callback as a listener for the event name.\n\n\nlistenTo(object, name, method)\nRegister method as a listener for the event name on object - method will automatically get bound to this.\n\n\nstopListening(object, name, method)\nUnregister method as a listener for the event name on object\n\n\n\nNote that SignalDispatcher extends Disposable, so it inherits all of its methods.\nTo understand the difference between on and listenTo, it's useful to realize that this.listenTo(myObject, 'event', this.onEvent) is equivalent to:\nvar handler = this.onEvent.bind(this)\nmyObject.on('event', handler);\nthis.link(() => myObject.off('event', handler));\n\nIn other words, listenTo is just a shorthand for registering an event handler on another object, and making sure that it gets unregistered when the target object is disposed.\n"},"pages/reference/core/TaskQueue.html":{"url":"pages/reference/core/TaskQueue.html","title":"TaskQueue","keywords":"","body":"TODO\n"},"pages/reference/decorators/Action.html":{"url":"pages/reference/decorators/Action.html","title":"@Action","keywords":"","body":"TODO\n"},"pages/reference/decorators/Abstract.html":{"url":"pages/reference/decorators/Abstract.html","title":"@Abstract","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\n@Abstract\n\n\n@Abstract\nThe @Abstract decorator lets you mark a method as abstract - this is a way of forcing anybody who extends your class to implement the method.

Essentially, the attributes of a component define its interface. This is in contrast to @Observable, which is used for private state.\nLike @Observable, under the hood, this sets up a getter and setter for the property, so that Twist knows which expressions depend on it, and when it changes. \nUsage:\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n    @Attribute property;\n    @Attribute propertyWithDefault = 2;\n    @Attribute(PropTypes.number) numberProperty = 4;\n}\n\nUnlike @Observable, @Attribute only makes sense for instance properties of a component.

This intermediate observable will get updated only when any observables that the getter depends on are changed. This is useful if the computation in the getter is expensive.\nUsage:\nclass C extends Disposable {\n    @Cache\n    get instanceProperty() {\n    }\n}\n\nNote that because @Cache uses observables the hood, it can only be used on a class that inherits from Disposable - this includes @Component and @Store, which inherit from Disposable. This ensures that the observable is disposed whenever an instance of the class is disposed. Similarly, @Cache can't be used on a static getter, because there's no way to dispose the observable it creates (this could lead to memory leaks).\n@Cache differs from @Memoize in that the latter will only ever execute the getter once (never subsequently updating), whereas the former will re-evaluate the getter whenever any observables it depends on change.\nTo understand when to use @Cache, let's consider a concrete example:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    @Observable x;\n\n    get value() {\n        return f(this.x);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            { this.value }\n            { this.value }\n        \n    }\n}\n\nHere, we have a getter (value) that returns some function of the observable property x. In the above example, whenever this.x changes, the two data bindings for this.value will be invalidated (because they depend on this.x), and the render method will be executed. This means that whenever this.x changes, f(this.x) will be executed twice.\nMost of the time this is not a problem, but if f() is an expensive computation, it would be nice to avoid executing it more often than necessary. By decorating the getter for value with @Cache, the result of f(this.x) is stored in an intermediate observable, and only computed once when this.x changes. Since the bindings to this.value just pull directly from the intermediate observable, f(this.x) will only be executed once whenever f(this.x) changes.\nSince @Cache is a tradeoff - it adds to memory usage, and a bit of overhead to the getter - only use it when the computation is sufficiently expensive and/or widely used to benefit from caching.\n"},"pages/reference/decorators/Component.html":{"url":"pages/reference/decorators/Component.html","title":"@Component","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\n@Component\n\n\n@Component\nThe @Component decorator turns a class into a Twist component.

This allows you to create aliases for more complex expressions. It takes two attributes:\n\nvalue - the expression to evaluate.\nas - the variable to assign the expression to. Note that this must be a free identifier - if you try to write an expression, you'll get an error.\n\nHere's a simple example of , where we assign the expression this.name to the variable name:\n@Component\nexport default class Component {\n    @Observable name;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: \n            \n            \n                \n                    Hello { name }!\n                \n            \n        \n    }\n}\n\nNote that if the value expression evaluates to a falsy value (false, 0, null, undefined, '', NaN), then the contents of the  tag will not be rendered.\nIf you need to handle this case, an  component can be used after , like the following:\n@Component\nexport default class Component {\n    @Observable name;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: \n            \n            \n                \n                    Hello { name }!\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Please enter your name.\n                \n            \n        \n    }\n}\n\nThe scope of the variable defined with as is limited to the contents of the  - you can't use it elsewhere in the JSX, so you get proper scoping. If you have a nested  that defines the same variable, then the innermost binding applies, as you'd expect:\nexport default \n    \n        Inner: { name }\n    ;\n    Outer: { name }\n;\n\nOne important use of  is to help with dynamically switching components - the only thing to remember is that custom components must start with an upper case letter. Here's an example:\n@Component\nclass MyButton {\n    render() {\n        return Button;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass MyTestButton {\n    render() {\n        return Test Button;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n    @Attribute isTest = false;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            \n                \n            \n        ;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"pages/reference/middleware/":{"url":"pages/reference/middleware/","title":"Using Middleware","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nMiddleware\n\n\nMiddleware\nWhen you create a store, you can also pass in a middleware argument to the constructor.

A common mistake is to do something asynchronous, like a network call, or setting a timeout. The problem with this, is that it makes the changes to the store in response to an action non-deterministic. If you're using the DevTools Middleware, this poses a particular problem, because it needs to be able to replay synchronous actions as you move forwards and backwards in time.\nTo help detect such common mistakes, Twist comes with protector middleware that automatically blocks certain common asynchronous operations from inside of synchronous action handlers - for example, setTimeout, setInterval, and the use of promises. If you need to do something asynchronous, just make the action asynchronous (@Action({async: true}))! Since this has to replace some of the browser globals to achieve this, we recommend only using the protector middleware in your development environment / builds - not for production builds.\nTo use this middleware, just pass it in when creating your store:\nimport { protectorMiddleware } from '@twist/core';\n\nvar store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE, [protectorMiddleware]);\n\n"},"pages/reference/middleware/remoteDevMiddleware.html":{"url":"pages/reference/middleware/remoteDevMiddleware.html","title":"remoteDevMiddleware","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nDevTools Middleware\n\n\nDevTools Middleware\nRedux-devtools-extension is a browser plugin for Chrome/Firefox (and also Electron), that was built for debugging Redux applications. Twist comes bundled with middleware for connecting to this, so it's really easy to debug your store. Just pass in the middleware when creating your store:\nimport { remoteDevMiddleware } from '@twist/core';\n\nvar store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE, [remoteDevMiddleware]);\n\nIf you don't already have the browser plugin, you can install it from here.\nThe plugin records all the actions and changes to the state of your store, and lets you time travel to previous states, toggle actions, and do diffing on the state. This is all connected live to your application, so you can easily see how changes in the state get reflected in the view. You can also dispatch actions from the plugin, and save and restore the state, so you can pass it to somebody else, or include it in a bug report.\nWe recommend only using the remotedev middleware in your development environment / builds - not for production builds. This is because (a) you probably don't want your users to be able to debug your application, and (b) it adds a fair amount of overhead if the redux-devtools-extension is installed, since it records all changes to the state.\n"},"pages/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.html":{"url":"pages/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.html","title":"Acknowledgements","keywords":"","body":"Twist Acknowledgements\nTwist, and the libraries around Twist, evolved over a number of years at Adobe, and many people have contributed to it during this time.
