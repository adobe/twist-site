Reactive State-Management for JavaScript Applications\n\nA web application is a lot like an iceberg - what you see on the surface is just a tiny fraction of the complexity that lies beneath the waves. To a casual observer, it's easy to get absorbed by beautiful designs, and be amazed by how a little CSS and JavaScript can give rise to such immersive experiences. But the more complex an application becomes, the more critically it depends on a solid foundation - the nuts and bolts of component hierarchies, state management, and caching layers that hold the whole thing together.\nTwist is a library that arose in light of these problems, by focusing on application state, and how it gets bound to reusable UI components. Twist is not a UI framework in its own right, but it does provide a syntax for writing components that's compatible with other frameworks, such as React. It uses a structured reactive approach, so that you easily scale your application, while maintaining an easy way of binding to the view - you'll recognize concepts that were inspired by Mobx and Redux, which are both very popular state-management libraries for React.\nTo give you a feel for what Twist looks like, here's a small fragment of code, showing part of a model (a store), and part of a view (a component). Notice that stores can nest other stores (DOB and Address are also stores, but aren't shown):\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal name;\n    @State.byVal description;\n    @State.byRef(DOB) birthday;\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n\n    @Action CHANGE_DESCRIPTION(newDescription) {\n        this.description = newDescription;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass ProfileView {\n    @Attribute user;\n    @Observable newDescription;\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.newDescription = this.user.description;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Hello { this.user.name }!\n            \n                Happy Birthday!!\n            \n            About yourself: \n             this.user.dispatch('CHANGE_DESCRIPTION', this.newDescription) }>Save\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nThe Twist Documentation explains everything in great detail, but here's a preview of the main concepts:\n\nApplication state is placed in stores - these are serializable to/from JSON, and the @State.xxx decorators tell Twist how to serialize each property (which can itself be another store).\nStores are modified via actions - this ensures that all changes go through a single bottleneck (the \"dispatcher\"), so that you can reason about all the changes to your state. In particular, this means that Twist supports time-traveling debugging, using the Redux Devtools Extension.\nAny state that can change is marked as observable, which allows Twist to know what to update when it changes (anything marked with @State.xxx is implicitly observable).\nUI components have attributes as a means of passing in arguments, and a render function that declaratively shows how to render the component (this uses JSX syntax). When anything observable changes that the component depends on, the rendered view will be automatically updated.\n\nWhile the state portion of Twist is framework-agnostic, the implementation of components depends on which UI framework is used. Right now, Twist only supports React, via React-Twist, but it's designed so that there can be other implementations in the future (and we encourage contributions if you're interested in helping with this!). This would allow the same component to work with multiple UI frameworks, which would be great for shared component libraries! Even today, React-Twist makes it really easy to use Twist stores with React, and also adds a bunch of features on top of React to make your life easier. See here for a complete description of the features.\n\nNote: In case you're wondering, React-Twist components are React components - they just automatically optimize when to re-render, so you don't need to think about it. If you write a component in React-Twist, it can be used directly by a normal React application. Similarly, React-Twist components can use normal React components directly - everything is rendered via React and ReactDOM.\n\nUsing Twist\nIf you want to use both the state-management and component layers of Twist, you'll need to install the following (via NPM or Yarn):\n\n@twist/core - This includes support for stores, data binding, and application state management.\n@twist/react - The React implementation of Twist components.\n@twist/react-webpack-plugin - A webpack plugin that compiles Twist files (Twist has its own Babel transform that runs before React's).\n\nIf you're not using webpack, you can also get hold of the Babel configuration directly, using @twist/configuration (this is done automatically by the webpack plugin).\nAfter that, the only thing you need is a .twistrc file in the root of your project, that tells Twist which libraries to include (this is also used by the Twist ESLint plugin). There are a number of advanced options, but to get up and running, you just need to tell Twist that you're using React-Twist:\n{\n    \"libraries\": [\n        \"@twist/react\"\n    ]\n}\n\nIn your webpack.conf.js you can now include the React Twist plugin - by default this will compile all files that end in .jsx with Twist and React:\nconst ReactTwistPlugin = require('@twist/react-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    plugins: [\n        new ReactTwistPlugin(),\n        ...\n    ],\n    ...\n};\n\n"},"pages/getting-started/":{"url":"pages/getting-started/","title":"Introduction to Twist","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nIntroduction to Twist\nImportant things to know\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Twist\nTwist is a state management and container library for JavaScript. It combines some of the best ideas from both Mobx and Redux. It is inspired by Mobx's observables and mutable state, while also using Redux's concepts of stores and actions to ensure a single pipeline through which state can be mutated. The former mutability allows for an extremely fast and performant state library, while the latter ensures that state is easily managed and tracked (including with time-travelling debugging tools). Twist also approaches front end development from the perspective of state first, rather than the view layer first, as is typical with many other frameworks. Twist has bindings for React now, and the community is invited to work on bindings for other frameworks.\nTwist makes it incredibly easy to create performant, scaleable stateful applications. Twist makes it easy to:\n\nencapsulate your application state in a centralized location, outside of the views/components.\nexport/import your application state to/from JSON – this is important for persistence, and server-side rendering.\ndebug changes to the application state using the excellent Redux Devtools Extension.\n\nTwist can be used without any particular front-end framework, but Twist becomes even more powerful when combined with React using the React bindings for Twist. When combined with these bindings, it's easy to:\n\ncreate reactive components that render in response to changes in stores.\nuse declarative JSX extensions to perform iterations and conditionals.\nuse JSX extensions to make it easy to work with CSS styles and classes.\n\nImportant things to know\nTwist is built on modern JavaScript (ES2015 and above), and utilizes Babel to transpile the code to ES5 so that your code can run on a wide variety of browsers. As such, you should be familiar with the following ES2015+ concepts in order to effectively utilize Twist:\n\nModules (import and export)\nClasses\nArrow functions\n\nIn general, Twist tries to use standard ES2015+ features. However, there are a couple of features that Twist uses a lot that aren't yet fully standardized:\n\nDecorators\nClass Fields\n\n\nNote: Technically you can use Twist without using decorators or class fields. However, these features are extremely useful and productive, and is what we'll use in all example code. If anyone in the community wants to add information on using Twist without decorators or class fields, pull requests are most welcome.\n\n"},"pages/getting-started/installation.html":{"url":"pages/getting-started/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nInstalling Twist\n\n\nInstalling Twist\n\nNOTE: The easiest way to start using Twist is to use one of our pre-configured starter projects. These are pre-configured with Webpack, Babel, and various plugins to make Twist development easy.\n\nTwist is available on npm.

This is accomplished by adding a .twistrc file to the root of your project.\nFor example, if you want to indicate that you're using the React Twist bindings from @twist/react, you'd create the following .twistrc:\n{\n    \"libraries\": [\n        \"@twist/react\"\n    ]\n}\n\nUsing React Twist bindings with Webpack\nIf you want to use Twist and the React bindings with Webpack, you can use @twist/react-webpack-plugin in your webpack configuration. If you don't need to change any configuration settings, the following is sufficient to compile all .jsx files using the React Twist bindings:\nconst ReactTwistPlugin = require('@twist/react-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    /*...*/\n    plugins: [\n        /*...*/\n        new ReactTwistPlugin()\n        /*...*/\n    ]\n    /*...*/\n}\n\nFor more examples of bundler configurations, refer to the starter projects.\n"},"pages/getting-started/starter-projects.html":{"url":"pages/getting-started/starter-projects.html","title":"Starter Projects","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nStarter Projects\n\n\nStarter Projects\nThe easiest way to get started with Twist is to clone one of the following starter projects.

For example, both have the concept of \"observables\", and even use the same decorator (@observable). There are, however, many important differences between the two libraries that make a direction 1:1 translation difficult.\n\nNOTE: Mobx itself is framework agnostic. In this comparison, the assumption is that one is using mobx in conjunction with React. This uses the mobx-react library in addition to mobx. Likewise, Twist itself is framework agnostic – this document assumes one is using the React Twist bindings.\n\nState Container\nMobx is fairly explicit about not being a state container. It just provides the wiring for observables and observers, with some mechanisms for injecting stores. As such, you're free to build your stores however you like. If you want something more opinionated that can serialize, time travel, etc., then mobx-state-tree is worth checking out. \nExplicit Imports\nUnlike Twist, explicit imports are favored over injected imports:\nimport { observable, computed, action } from 'mobx';\nimport { observer, inject } from 'mobx-react';\n\nDecorators\nMobx advocates for the use of decorators, since they can reduce boilerplate and are easier to read, but Mobx does document how to avoid using decorators. Twist uses decorators as well, but doesn't currently document how to avoid using them.\n/* mobx */\nexport default class ColorStore {\n    @observable hue = 100;\n    /* ... */\n\n    @computed\n    get color() {\n        return `hsl(${this.hue}, ${this.sat}%, ${this.lum}%)`;\n    }\n\n    @action\n    setColor(color) {\n        this.color.hue = color.hue;\n        /* ... */\n    }\n}\n\n/* twist */\n@Store\nexport default class ColorStore {\n    @Observable hue = 100;\n    /* ... */\n\n    get color() {\n        return `hsl(${this.hue}, ${this.sat}%, ${this.lum}%)`;\n    }\n\n    @Action\n    SET_COLOR(color) {\n        this.color.hue = color.hue;\n        /* ... */\n    }\n}\n\nObservables\nObservables in Mobx are very similar to those in Twist. One key difference is with observable arrays, however. In both cases, arrays are transformed into something else, but where Twist wraps the array with ObservableArray, Mobx converts the array to an object (with the expected methods, like map). This has the benefit of letting us continue to use brackets to index the array (because we can use brackets on objects), but it has the downside that the observable array is most definitely not a real array, and some degree of work has to go into making it act like one.\n/* Mobx */\n@observable name = \"Alex\";\nconst anArray = observable([1, 2, 3]);\nanArray[0] = 4; // this works in Mobx\n\n/* Twist */\n@Observable name = \"Alex\";\nconst anArray = ObservableArray([1, 2, 3]);\nanArray.setAt(0, 4); // Twist equivalent\n\nExplicit Observation\nIn Twist one only needs to instrument what is observable. Twist then takes care of invalidating bindings and updating dependencies as needed. In Mobx, one must instrument what is doing the observing as well by indicating that a component is going to be observing something (the something itself doesn't matter).\nThere are multiple ways of defining something as an observer:\n\nReact stateful components can be marked as an observer by using the @observer decorator.\nReact functional (stateless) components can be marked as an observer by using the observer function.\nParts of the render tree can be marked as observers by using the  component.\n\nOne is encouraged to observe as much as makes sense. If one doesn't, an expensive render method will create a poor user experience.\n\nNOTE: Observations are tracked only within the render method. This is does not extend to callbacks or children's render methods (unless they are also tagged as observers).\n\n@observer\nexport default class PictureEditor extends Component {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nexport default observer(function Picture(props) { /* ... */ });\n\nrender() {\n    return (\n        \n            { /* ... */ }\n            {\n                () => {\n                    \n                }\n            }\n            { /* ... */ }\n        \n    );\n}\n\nStores are Injected\nStores can be provided to children using the  component. Children receive their stores via injection ((@)inject) and can reference the store using props.\nIn Twist, stores are often provided via scope.\n@inject(\"pictureStore\")\n@observer\nexport default class PictureEditor extends Component {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nStores are not typed\nAs mentioned above, Mobx has no opinions regarding state containers. As such, serialization is not provided by default. You can still do it, but you have to reconstruct the correct types yourself.\nWith Twist, the contents of stores are typed and can be automatically serialized.\n+ mobx-state-tree\nmobx-state-tree adds in capabilities that we typically associate with Twist, including:\n\nSerialization\nTime travel\nMiddleware (including connecting to Redux Dev Tools)\n\nExplicit Import\nmobx-state-tree expects that you'll import it explicitly.\nimport { types } from 'mobx-state-tree';\n\nModels are typed\nBecause models in mobx-state-tree support serialization, they are typed. Types include the expected primitives as well as arrays and maps. Fields can be indicated as optional, and can also provide defaults. This is similar to Twist.\nDefining Models\nModels are defined using the types.model method and not by creating a class.\n/* mobx-state-tree */\nexport default types.model( \"ColorStore\", {\n    hue: types.optional(types.number, 0), /* ... */\n});\n\n/* Twist */\n@Store\nexport default class ColorStore {\n    @State.byNumberVal hue = 0;\n}\n\nComputed properties (called \"views\") are added using a chained method (view). Note the use of self instead of this in the following example:\n/* mobx-state-tree */\nexport default types.model( \"ColorStore\", {\n    hue: types.optional(types.number, 0), /* ... */\n}).views(self => {\n    return {\n        get color() {\n            return `hsl(${self.hue}, ...)`;\n        }\n    };\n});\n\n/* Twist */\n@Store\nexport default class ColorStore {\n    @State.byNumberVal hue = 0;\n\n    get color() {\n        return `hsl${this.hue}, ...)`;\n    }\n}\n\nModels are mutable, but only within the context of an action. Otherwise attempting to change a property directly will throw an error. The same is true with Twist, unless the store is explicitly set to be mutable (in which case implicit actions are created underneath the hood).\n/* mobx-state-tree */\nexport default types.model( \"ColorStore\", {\n    hue: types.optional(types.number, 0), /* ... */\n}).views(self => {\n    return { /* ... */ };\n}).actions(self => {\n    return {\n        setColor(color) {\n            this.color.hue = color.hue;\n        }\n    };\n});\n\n/* Twist */\n@Store\nexport default class ColorStore {\n    /* ... */\n\n    @Action\n    SET_COLOR(color) {\n        this.color.hue = color.hue;\n    }\n}\n\nDispatching Actions\nActions are called like methods on the model. When connecting to Redux Dev Tools, the action name is used automatically.\nTwist uses the dispatch method on the store to call an action.\n/* mobx-state-tree */\ncolor.setColor({hue: 50}); // equivalent to dispatch('setColor', ...);\n\n/* Twist */\ncolor.dispatch(\"SET_COLOR\", {hue: 50});\n\nSerialization\nSerialization is as easy with mobx-state-tree as it is with Twist. One requests a vanilla JS object, which can then be serialized using JSON.stringify. Deserialization works similarly -- a string is converted using JSON.parse and the store is reconstructed from the result.\n/* mobx-state-tree */\nimport { getSnapshot, applySnapshot } from 'mobx-state-tree';\n/* ... */\nsave() {\n    const json = JSON.stringify(getSnapshot(this.props.pictureStore), null, 2);\n    this.props.storage.setItem('picture', json);\n}\n\nload() {\n    const json = this.props.storage.getItem('picture');\n    if (json) {\n        try {\n            const data = JSON.parse(json);\n            applySnapshot(this.props.pictureStore, data);\n        } catch (err) {\n            throw new Error('Could not parse JSON');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n/* Twist */\n// TODO\n\nMiddleware\nVarious middlwares are provided, including ones that faciliate time travel and undo. A utility method is also provided to enable the use or Redux Devtools:\n/* mobx-state-tree */\nimport { connectReduxDevtools } from 'mst-middlewares';\n/* ... */\nconnectReduxDevtools(require(\"remotedev\"), pictureStore);\n\n/* Twist */\nimport { remoteDevMiddleware } from '@twist/core';\n\nconst store = new PictureStore(INITIAL_STATE, [remoteDevMiddleware]);\n\nRedux Devtools works as expected in the above configuration.\n"},"pages/fundamentals/observables.html":{"url":"pages/fundamentals/observables.html","title":"Observables","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nObservables\nBindings\nReactivity\nNon-primitive fields\n\n\n\n\nObservables\nTwist is built around the concepts of observables and reactivity. To accomplish this, Twist relies upon you to instrument your data model and stores by indicating which of your model's fields should be observed. You can then build your app to respond to changes on those fields using watches or other components that are designed to track references for you automatically.\nAn observable is a class field that has been instrumented with the @Observable decorator. This decorator will automatically create a getter and a setter to track references and changes to the field.\nBindings\nAn observable tracks references, or bindings, to observables whenever those fields are accessed. By keeping track of those accesses, it's possible to build a dependency tree during runtime. Then, should any dependency be invalidated, the other bindings can also be invalidated and then re-evaluated.\nReactivity\nWhenever a field is modified, the associated bindings are automatically invalidated and re-evaluated. When this occurs, notifications are generated which indicate that a change has occurred. You can subscribe to these notifications by using the watch method on any class that inherits from SignalDispatcher.\nNon-primitive fields\nThe @Observable decorator only works with primitive fields – that is, fields that are of a primitive type (like a number or string). In order to observe changes within an Array, Set, or Map, one must create an observable instance. Twist provides an observable wrapper for each case: ObservableArray, ObservableSet, and ObservableMap. In each case, the methods you would expect are present, although ObservableArrays are not indexed using brackets as are Arrays. Instead you can use at and setAt. For example:\n\n\n\nArray instance\nObservableArray instance\n\n\n\n\nconst x = a[1];\nconst x = a.at(1);\n\n\na[2] = x;\na.setAt(2, x);\n\n\n\n"},"pages/fundamentals/components.html":{"url":"pages/fundamentals/components.html","title":"Components","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nComponents\nA simple Twist component\nInternal State\nAttributes\nTODO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nMost modern UI frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) have the concept of components. A component, in short, is just an encapsulated bit of logic that interacts with and optionally renders a mapping of your app's state. You can combine (compose) these components together into interesting and complex user interfaces, while also gaining the benefits of modularity and reusability.\nA Twist Component looks largely the same regardless of which UI framework you're targeting. That's because Twist components implement a consistent interface across all supported frameworks. Of course, if you're only targeting React, then you can still use React-specific functionality, but if you want your Twist component to work across the supported frameworks, then you'll want to write idiomatic Twist components.\nA simple Twist component\nLet's take a quick look at what a simple Twist component would look like:\n@Component\nclass HelloWorld {\n    render() {\n        return Hello, World;\n    }\n}\n\nWe could then use this component in another component's render method like so:\n\n\nInternal State\nA Twist component can have internal state by using observables. By using observables you can react to any changes that might occur.\nLet's create a simple clock component that maintains some internal state:\n@Component()\nclass Clock {\n    @Observable date = new Date();\n\n    @Bind\n    update() {\n        this.date = new Date();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        setInterval(this.update, 1000);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return {this.date.toLocaleTimeString()};\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, note that we define our clock's internal state by using @Observable, and we're creating a new class field called date and setting it to the current date (via new Date()). By instrumenting our date as observable, we can make changes to it and trigger a fresh rendering.\nNext we create a method called update that will be responsible for updating the component's internal state. As you can see, it's really easy – we just assign a new Date instance to this.date. Because it's observable, anything that is bound to this value will be invalidated and re-evaluated.\nBut update on its own doesn't do anything – we have to trigger it somehow. The best place to do that is by using the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Once the instance is rendered in the DOM, this lifecycle method is called and we can create an interval that calls update every second.\n\nNOTE: Notice that when we defined update we prefixed it with @Bind. This is a convenience decorator that we can use to automatically bind the method to the instance. If we didn't do this, we'd have to do something like setInterval(() => this.update, 1000) to ensure that we were referring to the correct this.\n\nFinally, we render the date's time portion in the render method. This will be updated every second because update will be modifying our component's internal state every second.\nAttributes\nOn its own, a component with no public interface doesn't provide a lot of functionality. We need a way to provide data to the component, as well as a way to respond to events that the component might trigger.\nComponents expose a public interface via attributes. If you're familiar with React, this is roughly equivalent to React's props. Twist uses the term attribute because this is the same term used when building HTML elements.\nAttributes are defined by using the @Attribute decorator. These attributes are themselves observable. Let's create a timer component that will count down from a specified time.\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\n@Component\nclass Timer {\n    @Attribute(PropTypes.number) seconds = 60;\n    @Observable startTime;\n    @Observable currentTime;\n\n    get secondsRemaining() {\n        return Math.max(\n            Math.round(\n                this.seconds - (this.currentTime - this.startTime) / 1000\n            ),\n            0\n        );\n    }\n\n    @Bind\n    update() {\n        this.currentTime = performance.now();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        this.startTime = performance.now();\n        this.currentTime = this.startTime;\n        setInterval(this.update, 1000);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return {this.secondsRemaining};\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we're mixing observables with attributes. We need some internal state to track the actual elapsed time (setInterval isn't actually terribly accurate), and we also need to expose an external interface so that a consumer can pass in a specific number of seconds from which we can count down. For example:\n\n\nWe've also done something else interesting in this component: the actual seconds remaining is calculated in a getter. The render method will still be triggered whenever the currentTime observable is updated, even though the render method doesn't directly reference currentTime.\nTODO:\n\nref should be a reference, not a function\nrender should only ever be a return with JSX.

But what about the application's state? Keeping state in UI components is generally a bad idea, unless that state is tightly coupled to the view - for example, it's good to store the \"checked\" state of a checkbox inside the control, but it's bad to store the details of the logged in user.\nThe great news in Twist is that all the observable primitives you've seen (@Observable, ObservableArray, ObservableMap, etc) - aren't restricted to components. They can be used anywhere in your application, to give you complete flexibility over how you structure your model. The only one that doesn't make sense outside of a component is @Attribute, because that exposes a JSX interface for setting the property - in other contexts, @Observable suffices.\nDecoupling Models from Views\nLet's say you want to create some classes to represent the data model of your application - for example, the state of the logged in user:\nclass UserData {\n    @Observable name;\n    @Observable email;\n    @Observable address;\n}\n\nThat was easy! You just instrument your classes with @Observable - any view that accesses one of these fields will now get automatically updated when it changes.\nThe next question is where to store your state? One approach would be to create a singleton that stores the state (like a global variable) that can be imported and accessed from anywhere in your app. This leads to problems if you later need to have multiple instances running at the same time - it's a lot of effort to go back and refactor all of your global state. Another approach would be to pass the state around your components using attributes, but this quickly gets messy - especially if your component hierarchy is very deep.\nTo solve this problem more cleanly, Twist has a mechanism called scopes.\nSharing State with Scopes\nIn Twist, a scope is an object that's shared by a component and all of its children. It's accessible within any component, via this.scope. At the point you attach your application to the DOM, Twist creates a global scope that gets shared by all the components you create.\nLet's take a look at an example, using scopes to share an instance of UserData throughout an application:\n@Component({fork: true})\nclass MyContainer {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.userData = new UserData();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n    render() {\n        return { this.scope.userData.name };\n    }\n}\n\nHere, MyComponent has direct access to userData because it was placed on the scope by its parent component - in both components, this.scope is the same object. \nScopes in Twist are inherited prototypically, so when you fork a scope, it means you still have read access to anything on the scope in the context where your component is used. But anything you write to the scope won't be visible outside of your component and its children. Also, when the component is disposed, its forked scope will be disposed at the same time - there's no need for you to manually clean it up. As a rule of thumb, if you're adding anything to the scope, you should be forking it!\nOne subtlety to bear in mind, is if you add an object to the scope (or anywhere else on the component) that holds resources that need to be cleaned up later. In this case, you need to dispose it when the component is disposed. Twist provides an easy shortcut for this, by using the link method on a component. You can write:\nthis.scope.userData = this.link(new UserData());\n\nThis tells Twist to call this.scope.userData.dispose() when the component is disposed - you just add a dispose method to UserData with your cleanup logic. If you have a tree of objects that all need to get disposed, it's a good idea to inherit from Disposable.

To define a store, simply make a new class using the @Store decorator. An instance of a store has properties for storing state, just like any JavaScript object. The difference is that in a store, we need to be explicit about how to serialize/deserialize the state to/from JSON. We do this using @State.XXX decorators on each of the properties (e.g. @State.byVal, @State.byRef etc). The @State.XXX decorators automatically make the properties observable, so there's no need to add @Observable in addition.\nStores are immutable by default, meaning that you can read the @State.XXX properties via data bindings from your view, but you can't directly modify them. If you want to modify one of these properties via two-way data binding, you need to create a local getter/setter as a proxy, so that you can dispatch an action in the setter (see the section on Actions below). Alternatively, you can make the store mutable, so that this mapping to an action happens automatically (see the section on Mutable Stores).\nHere's a simple example of a store - notice that you can put one store inside another, using @State.byRef:\n@Store\nclass Address {\n    @State.byVal state;\n    @State.byNumberVal zipCode;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n}\n\nEvery store has the methods toJSON() and fromJSON() methods, for serializing the store to/from a JSON. Additionally, @Store and @State.XXX prevent the state from being modified outside of an action handler - which we'll now describe!\n\nNote: toJSON() doesn't return a JSON string, but rather a plain JavaScript that can be serialized to a string via JSON.stringify. This is to allow you to control the exact formatting (e.g. whether you want line breaks and indentation, etc).\n\nActions\nBy itself, a store is fairly useless, because it can't be modified - the @State.XXX decorators prevent you from writing something like ...user.firstName = 'Bob' directly in your code - it will throw an exception.\nTo allow state to be modified, you add actions to your store. The handler for an action is just a method, decorated with @Action - you can think of the @Action decorator as giving special permission to modify the state. Actions are invoked by calling store.dispatch() with the name of the action. Let's take a look at a simple example:\n@Store\nclass MyStore {\n\n    @State.byRef(User) user;\n\n    @Action SET_USER_TITLE(title) {\n        this.user.title = title;\n    }\n}\n\nTo invoke the SET_USER_TITLE action in the above store, you would call:\nstore.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', title)\nYou can pass any number of parameters to an action, and they get passed in as the arguments to the handler.\nWe deviate from Redux here in two important ways. Firstly, the action handler (called a reducer in Redux) is not a pure function - it mutates the state, rather than returning a new state. Secondly, we've put the logic for the actions in the store, with a separate function for each action (as opposed to a single function with a switch statement). We think this makes it a bit easier to read/write.\nAs we mentioned earlier, stores can be composed using @State.byRef. For example:\n@Store\nclass MyStore1 {\n    ...\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyStore2 {\n    ...\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyMainStore {\n    @State.byRef(MyStore1) store1;\n    @State.byRef(MyStore2) store2;\n}\n\nDispatched actions get propagated to the sub-stores, so you can easily split up your application state into different pieces. Similarly, when you call store.toJSON() or store.fromJSON(), it will recurse through the sub-stores in addition to normal state.\nBy default, dispatched actions get propagated to all sub-stores of the store you dispatch to. The handler of the parent store will get called first, followed by the handlers of sub-stores. There are two ways to prevent the action from being propagated to sub-stores:\n\nReturn true from the action handler. This indicates that the action has been handled, and doesn't need to be propagated further.\nChange @Action to @Action({propagate: false}) - this tells Twist not to propagate the action (regardless of the return value of the action handler).\n\nConnecting Model and View\nHooking up a store (your model) to the view-layer of your application is easy. The top-level component (e.g. the main entry point for your application) creates a new store, and make it accessible to the rest of the application. If you're using React-Twist, you can do this using scope, as the following simple example illustrates:\n@Component({ fork: true })\nclass MyMainView {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        // Assume we get INITIAL_STATE from the server, or from some local storage\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE);\n    }\n\n    get store() {\n        return this.scope.store;\n    }\n\n    knight() {\n        this.store.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', 'Sir');\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            { this.store.user.fullName }\n             this.knight() }>Make Knight\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nNote that when you pass in INITIAL_STATE to the store's constructor, this actually maps onto a special @@INIT action that populates the state - this ensures that all state mutations happen through actions, even initialization!\nStores and Two-Way Data Binding\nSometimes, having to dispatch actions to change the state can be a pain - it means that you can't directly bind to a value in a store, using two-way data binding, because it can't be updated outside of an action handler. For example, let's say you want to update the title in the User store, as the user is typing this into an input field, and have the store update automatically whenever the input field changes. You can still use two-way data-binding, but you need to introduce a getter and setter as a proxy, where the setter dispatches the appropriate action:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore;\n    }\n\n    get title() {\n        return this.scope.store.user.title;\n    }\n\n    set title(newTitle) {\n        this.scope.store.dispatch('SET_USER_TITLE', newTitle);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\nMutable Stores\nIt would be easier if you could update the store directly, and so remove the need for the getter/setter. For this reason, Twist gives you the option of creating a mutable store. You can make a store mutable by passing a mutable option to the @Store decorator, as follows:\n@Store({mutable: true})\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n}\n\nThis lets you directly modify the store, so you can use two-way data binding to update it. This simplifies the above store to the following:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.scope.store = new MyStore;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return ;\n    }\n}\n\nThe important thing to remember about mutable stores is that they still use actions under the hood. When you modify the store, an action gets created for you, meaning that it goes through the parent store's middleware. This means you can still use the redux-devtools-extension with mutable stores! The following diagram illustrates what's going on under the hood:\n\nThere are four stages to this:\n\nWhen you change a mutable store, this gets converted to an action under the hood. The action name describes the property to set (or method to call), and the action payload is the value to assign to the property (or the arguments for the method).\n(green arrows) The action is routed up the store hierarchy to the top-level store, and passed through its middleware. If you're using redux-devtools-extension, you'll see an action that looks like 'storeA/storeB/@property' - this describes the path down the store hierarchy, and the property you were setting (in the case of a method, like calling store.items.push(...), it would look something like 'storeA/storeB/@items.push()').\n(red arrows) The action is routed back down to the store you changed - this is doing what's known as source routing in networking.\n(blue arrow) The implicit action gets applied to the store. Unlike a normal action, it doesn't get propagated to any child stores of the target.\n\nIn a mutable store, you can change any of the @State.XXX properties, as well as arrays and maps created by @State.byRefArray/@State.byRefMap. The only limitation is that the payload of the action (the value you set, or the arguments to the method you call) must be serializable - otherwise we wouldn't be able to record and replay the action. This means that while you can call this.items.reverse() directly, you can't call this.items.sort(sortFunction) because functions aren't serializable - you'd have to wrap it in an action.\nIf you don't specify the mutability of a store, it gets inherited from its parent. By default, stores are not mutable - but if you want to make all the stores mutable, just set the top-level store to mutable and the sub-stores will inherit this (you don't need to set mutable: true everywhere).\nNote that right now, we only allow configuring mutability at a store-level granularity - we may add support for controlling mutability on a per-property level in future.\nDerived State\nIn the store example so far, we've only added fields for the raw data. More commonly, however, we want to display data in the view that's derived from the model. If this data is generally useful (e.g. used in more than one view), it makes sense to move it to the model. This can be done simply by adding a getter:\n@Store\nclass User {\n    @State.byVal title;\n    @State.byVal firstName;\n    @State.byVal lastName;\n\n    @State.byRef(Address) address;\n\n    get fullName() {\n        return (this.title ? this.title + ' ' : '') + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\n    }\n}\n\nThere's nothing special needed here - Twist's data binding will work across the getter, so whenever the raw model data changes, anyone bound to the getter will also update.\nBut what happens if we have an expensive operation in the getter? For example, we might be filtering on an array and doing some iteration and/or array allocations. If it's a plain getter, then all data bindings that reference the getter in the application need to be re-evaluated whenever the raw state changes. That means we might be doing the same operation multiple times, which is inefficient. If this is the case, we can just mark the getter with the @Cache decorator:\n@Store\nclass MyState {\n\n    ...\n\n    @Cache\n    get myProperty() {\n        return this.expensiveComputation();\n    }\n}\n\nThis has the effect of introducing an intermediate property that watches the expression in the getter. When the state changes, the cache gets invalidated. Whenever the getter is invoked, it returns the cached value if there is one, or generates the cache. This means that if there are 10 places in the application that bind to this expression, it will only be re-evaluated once whenever the state changes.\nSince @Cache is a tradeoff - it adds to memory usage, and a bit of overhead to the getter - only use it when the computation is sufficiently expensive and/or widely used to benefit from caching.\nStores and Components\nSo far, we've described Twist from the perspective of an application, where you construct a single store for the entire application (which can be composed of other stores). In reality though, your application often consists of sub-components, some of which are not specific to your application, and may even be implemented by somebody else as a shared component.\nIf we continue with our example of the User store, let's imagine that we have a shared component that needs information about the logged-in user. If we already have a User store in our main store, then it doesn't make sense for the shared component to create another - there would be duplicate effort in populating the store (e.g. via extra network calls), and we'd have two user stores that could get out of sync with one another. So, let's pass in the store to the component:\n@Component({fork: true})\nclass UserProfileView {\n\n    @Attribute userStore;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: { this.userStore.name }\n            ...\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\n...\n\n\n\nBinding to data from the store is easy, but what about making changes to the store? You want all changes to go through the top-level store, so that it passes through a common middleware (e.g. if you're using redux-devtools-extension), but a shared components shouldn't need to know about how your application store is structured - it only cares about once small piece of the store.\nTo make life easy in cases like this, Twist lets you dispatch directly to a sub-store, and under the hood routes the action via the top-level store. The following diagram shows how this works:\n\nThere are three stages when you call dispatch on a child store:\n\n(green arrows) The action is routed up the store hierarchy to the top-level store, and passed through its middleware. If you're using redux-devtools-extension, you'll see an action that looks like 'storeA/storeB/ACTION_NAME' - this encodes the path down the store hierarchy into the action name.\n(red arrows) The action is routed back down to the store you changed - this is doing what's known as source routing in networking.\n(blue arrow) The action gets dispatched to the store. Just like if you dispatched an action to the top-level store, this gets propagated to child stores (essentially, broadcast down the tree), but only starting from the sub-store you dispatched to. Remember that you can prevent propagation by returning true in the action handler.\n\nThis makes it easy to pass stores to reusable components - they just need to agree on the interface that the store provides.\nOne thing to be careful of, is that you can't compose the same store inside of two parents. For example, the following is not allowed:\n@Store\nclass A {\n}\n\n@Store\nclass B {\n    @State.byRef(A) a;\n\n    @Action SET(a) {\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n}\n\nvar a = new A();\nvar b1 = new B();\nvar b2 = new B();\n\n// This succeeds, turning a into a sub-store of b1:\nb1.dispatch('SET', a);\n\n// This fails - since a is already a sub-store of b1, it can't also be a sub-store of b2:\nb2.dispatch('SET', a);\n\nThere are many good reasons for requiring the structure of your store hierarchy to strictly be a tree. The most obvious reasons are (a) it leads to a lot of confusing cases, like actions being handled multiple times by the same store, and not knowing which top-level store to pass actions through, and (b) links aren't preserved when you serialize to/from JSON.\nPitfalls\nWhile Twist makes it easy to persist stores, through having toJSON() and fromJSON() methods, it's easy to run into pitfalls due to persistence having side effects.\n#1: Overloading the constructor/initialization\nIf you want a store to load its data from local storage, the following might seem like a good idea:\n@Store\nclass MyStore() {\n    @State.byVal data;\n\n    constructor(initialState) {\n        // You really don't want to do this:\n        super(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myData')));\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, this is bad (other than the lack of try/catch) for two reasons:\n\nIt won't work if MyStore is nested inside another store, due to the way @State.byRef works - it first creates a new MyStore and then calls fromJSON() to initialize it. So your initial data will be overriden by whatever you passed into the main store.\n\nEven if it did work, it would violate the principle of \"determinism\" - all actions should be deterministic, so that you can replay/debug them. If they're not deterministic, you'll get a different answer each time you run it (or if you run it in different contexts), which makes it really hard to debug. It's the same reason why reducers in redux must be pure functions.\n\n\nInstead, there are two \"correct\" ways to initialize your store from local storage data:\n\nYou can pass this in, in the top-level JSON for your main store (i.e. when you call this.scope.store = new MainStore(INIT_DATA). This is deterministic, because the INIT action is self-contained - you've already read the data from local storage before initializing the store with it.\n\nYou might not like the first approach, because the top-level app needs to know where to load the data from. So, a good alternative is to define a LOAD action on the store, like so:\n\n\n@Store\nclass MyStore() {\n    @State.byVal data;\n\n    @Action _LOAD(data) {\n        try {\n            this.fromJSON(JSON.parse(data));\n        }\n        catch(e) {\n            console.error('Invalid data - aborted load', e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Action({ async: true }) LOAD_FROM_STORAGE() {\n        this.dispatch('_LOAD', localStorage.getItem('myData'));\n    }\n}\n\nNow, in the initialization code for the store, you'll do something like:\nthis.scope.store = new MainStore(INITIAL_DATA);\nthis.scope.store.settings.dispatch('LOAD_FROM_STORAGE');\nNote that since LOAD_FROM_STORAGE is asynchronous, you need to dispatch it directly on the store in question.\n#2. Non-deterministic actions, and actions with side effects\nYou might be wondering why the above example has two actions, rather than just one. It's again because of the principle that actions should be deterministic. Think about what would happen if you just wrote:\n@Store\nclass MyStore() {\n    @State.byVal data;\n\n    @Action LOAD_FROM_STORAGE() {\n        try {\n            this.fromJSON(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myData')));\n        }\n        catch(e) {\n            console.error('Invalid data - aborted load', e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you run this through redux devtools, you'll just see a single action \"LOAD_FROM_STORAGE\" in the logs. But if you were to undo, and then replay this action again, you'd get a different answer because local storage might have changed.\nFor this reason, you always want to separate anything that's non-deterministic, or has side effects, into an asynchronous action, and keep the actions deterministic.\nThe same thing applies when you save the store to local storage:\n@Action SET_DATA(value) {\n    this.data = value;\n    // Don't do this inside a synchronous action:\n    localStorage.setItem('myData', value);\n}\n\nHere, the action is deterministic, but it has side effects (saving to local storage). This will work fine with redux-devtools, because of the determinism, but it'll still cause you trouble if you undo/replay actions while debugging, because this will change the local storage as well. That could lead to you scratching your head... so just keep life simple, and restrict the side effects of actions to the store and its children.\nAs before, if we split it into a synchronous/asynchronous action pair, all is good:\n@Action _SET_DATA(value) {\n    this.data = value;\n}\n\n@Action({ async: true }) SET_DATA(value) {\n    this.dispatch('_SET_DATA', value);\n    localStorage.setItem('myData', value);\n}\n\n"},"pages/reference/core/AbstractComponent.html":{"url":"pages/reference/core/AbstractComponent.html","title":"AbstractComponent","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nAbstract Component\nInheritance\nComponent Lifecycle\nconstructor\nrender\ncomponentWillMount\ncomponentDidMount\ncomponentWillUnMount\n\n\nComponent APIs\nComponent Features\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Component\nTwist assumes an \"abstract component\" specification that is implemented by any view layer framework bindings.

For example, Component inherits from SignalDispatcher.\nA SignalDispatcher has a watch() method that's useful for programmatically reacting to changes on an expression. Here's an example, using a component as the instance of SignalDispatcher:\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n\n    @Observable value = 2;\n    @Observable computedValue;\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        this.watch(() => this.value, value => {\n            this.computedValue = 2 ** Number(this.value);\n        });\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Value: \n            Computed Value: { this.computedValue }\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a contrived example, because you could have just bound directly to the computation from the JSX, but sometimes you need to do something programmatically when a value changes - that's what watches are for!\nSignalDispatcher also comes with a number of methods for handling events. The basic building blocks are trigger() for triggering events, and on() and off() for registering event listeners. Here's an example:\nimport { SignalDispatcher } from '@twist/core';\n\nclass MyDispatcher extends SignalDispatcher {\n}\n\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.dispatcher = this.link(new MyDispatcher());\n    }\n\n    @Bind\n    onEvent() {\n        alert('Event Fired!')\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n             this.dispatcher.on('event', this.onEvent) }>Add Listener\n             this.dispatcher.off('event', this.onEvent) }>Remove Listener\n             this.dispatcher.trigger('event') }>Trigger Event\n        ;\n    }\n}\n\nInstance Methods\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nwatch(fn, callback)\nWatch the result of evaluating fn(). Whenever the value of fn() changes, callback will be invoked with the new value.\n\n\nwatchCollection(fn, callback)\nShallow watch the collection that's the result of evaluating fn(). Whenever the collection changes, callback will be invoked with the collection.\n\n\nmultiWatch(fns, callback)\nWatch an array of values - the results of evaluating each function in fns. Whenever any of the values changes, callback will be invoked with an array containing the new values.\n\n\ndefineObservable(key, defaultValue)\nDefine a new observable property key, with a default value of defaultValue. This is equivalent to instrumenting with @Observable (i.e. @Observable key = defaultValue).\n\n\ndispose()\nSame as Disposable.dispose (see Disposable), but also stops all listeners.\n\n\ntrigger(name, ...args)\nTrigger the event name (a string) - any additional arguments are passed to the event handlers\n\n\non(name, callback)\nRegister callback as a listener for the event name.\n\n\noff(name, callback)\nUnregister callback as a listener for the event name.\n\n\nlistenTo(object, name, method)\nRegister method as a listener for the event name on object - method will automatically get bound to this.\n\n\nstopListening(object, name, method)\nUnregister method as a listener for the event name on object\n\n\n\nNote that SignalDispatcher extends Disposable, so it inherits all of its methods.\nTo understand the difference between on and listenTo, it's useful to realize that this.listenTo(myObject, 'event', this.onEvent) is equivalent to:\nvar handler = this.onEvent.bind(this)\nmyObject.on('event', handler);\nthis.link(() => myObject.off('event', handler));\n\nIn other words, listenTo is just a shorthand for registering an event handler on another object, and making sure that it gets unregistered when the target object is disposed.\n"},"pages/reference/core/TaskQueue.html":{"url":"pages/reference/core/TaskQueue.html","title":"TaskQueue","keywords":"","body":"Task Queue\nA singleton representing Twist's task queue that is bound to requestAnimationFrame.

Because dispatch uses strings, it's common to define a static field on the store itself so that it can be later used when dispatching. For example:\n@Action\nSET_NAME(name) { /* ... */ }\nstatic SET_NAME = \"SET_NAME\"\n\nLater, one can use dispatch(TheStore.SET_NAME, {name: \"A name\"}).\nActions are synchronous by default, but can also be asynchronous.

This intermediate observable will get updated only when any observables that the getter depends on are changed. This is useful if the computation in the getter is expensive.\nUsage:\nclass C extends Disposable {\n    @Cache\n    get instanceProperty() {\n    }\n}\n\nNote that because @Cache uses observables the hood, it can only be used on a class that inherits from Disposable - this includes @Component and @Store, which inherit from Disposable. This ensures that the observable is disposed whenever an instance of the class is disposed. Similarly, @Cache can't be used on a static getter, because there's no way to dispose the observable it creates (this could lead to memory leaks).\n@Cache differs from @Memoize in that the latter will only ever execute the getter once (never subsequently updating), whereas the former will re-evaluate the getter whenever any observables it depends on change.\nTo understand when to use @Cache, let's consider a concrete example:\n@Component\nclass MyComponent {\n\n    @Observable x;\n\n    get value() {\n        return f(this.x);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            { this.value }\n            { this.value }\n        \n    }\n}\n\nHere, we have a getter (value) that returns some function of the observable property x. In the above example, whenever this.x changes, the two data bindings for this.value will be invalidated (because they depend on this.x), and the render method will be executed. This means that whenever this.x changes, f(this.x) will be executed twice.\nMost of the time this is not a problem, but if f() is an expensive computation, it would be nice to avoid executing it more often than necessary. By decorating the getter for value with @Cache, the result of f(this.x) is stored in an intermediate observable, and only computed once when this.x changes. Since the bindings to this.value just pull directly from the intermediate observable, f(this.x) will only be executed once whenever f(this.x) changes.\nSince @Cache is a tradeoff - it adds to memory usage, and a bit of overhead to the getter - only use it when the computation is sufficiently expensive and/or widely used to benefit from caching.\n"},"pages/reference/decorators/Component.html":{"url":"pages/reference/decorators/Component.html","title":"@Component","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\n@Component\n\n\n@Component\nThe @Component decorator turns a class into a Twist component.

The value will be converted into a number, using Number(value).\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byNumberVal prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 42});   // prop === 42\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: '42'}); // prop === 42\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 'x'});  // prop === NaN\n@State.bySimpleVal\nUse @State.bySimpleVal to serialize and store primitive values - unlike @State.byVal, this doesn't make a copy, so you shouldn't use it if you expect the value to be an object.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.bySimpleVal prop;\n}\n\nvar obj = { x: 2 };\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 2});   // prop === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: obj}); // prop === obj\n@State.byCustomVal(serializer, defaultValue)\nUse @State.byCustomVal if you want to control the serialization of the value. You pass in a serializer object to the component, which must have a parse function (called during fromJSON) and a serialize function (called during toJSON). You can also provide a default value that will get supplied to parse if the property is missing from the JSON provided to fromJSON.\nExample:\nvar serializer = {\n    parse: (jsonValue, object, propertyName) => {\n        return jsonValue === 'debug' ? 'test' : jsonValue;\n    },\n    serialize: (value, object, propertyName) => {\n        // value === object[propertyName]\n        return value === 'test' ? 'debug' : value;\n    }\n};\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byCustomVal(serializer, 'default') prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 'value'}); // prop === 'value'\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 'debug'}); // prop === 'test'\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});              // prop === 'default'\nNote that while you can supply any methods you like, you ought to make sure that parse(serialize(parse(x))) is equal to parse(x), and that serialize(parse(serialize(y))) is equal to serialize(y).\n@State.byRef(type)\nUse @State.byRef to store and deserialize a nested store. This allows you to build a much richer exportable structure. @State.byRef takes the class of the property as its argument, and always ensures that an instance of the class is created, even if the value is missing from the JSON provided to fromJSON.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byRef(MyNestedClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {x: 2} }); // prop instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                        // prop.x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});             // prop instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                        // prop.x === undefined\n@State.byOptionalRef(type)\n@State.byOptionRef does the same thing as @State.byRef, except that it won't create an instance of the class if the value is missing from the JSON provided to fromJSON.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byOptionalRef(MyNestedClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {x: 2} }); // prop instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                        // prop.x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});             // prop === null\n@State.byCustomRef(getType)\nUse @State.byCustomRef when you want to dynamically choose the type of the class to use for the property. Instead of providing a class as an argument, you provide a function that takes the JSON value as input - this lets you decide what class to use at the time fromJSON is called.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClassDebug {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\nvar getClass = function(jsonValue, object) {\n    return jsonValue.isDebug ? MyNestedClassDebug : MyNestedClass;\n};\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byCustomRef(getClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {x: 2} });                // prop instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                                       // prop.x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {x: 2, isDebug: true} }); // prop instanceof MyNestedClassDebug\n                                                       // prop.x === 2\nIf you need to use the same class, but instantiated in different ways (i.e. passing different options to the constructor), you can also return an instance of the Exportable class from getClass - in this case, the instance you provide will be used. For example:\nvar getClass = function(jsonValue, object) {\n    return jsonValue.isDebug ? new MyNestedClass({debug: true}) : new MyNestedClass();\n};\n@State.byArray(isStatic)\nUse @State.byArray to deserialize JSON into an ObservableArray, where each item in the array is a primitive value (e.g. if you have an array of strings or numbers). If each item in the array is a more complex object, consider using @State.byRefArray instead. This lets you bind to the contents of the array from a view - for example, iterating over the array in the render function of a component.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byArray prop;\n}\n\nvar array = [ 2, 3 ];\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: array}); // prop instanceof ObservableArray\n                                       // prop.at(0) === 2\n                                       // prop.at(1) === 3\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 42});    // prop instanceof ObservableArray\n                                       // prop.length === 0\nIf you want the property to become a normal array rather than an ObservableArray, pass in true as the second parameter (isStatic).\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byArray(true) prop;\n}\n\nvar array = [ 2, 3 ];\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: array}); // prop instanceof Array\n                                       // prop[0] === 2\n                                       // prop[1] === 3\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});            // prop instanceof Array\n                                       // prop.length === 0\n@State.byRefArray(type, isStatic)\nUse @State.byRefArray to deserialize JSON into an ObservableArray, where each item in the array is an instance of the class you pass in as a parameter. This is in contrast to @State.byArray, where the items in the array are primitive types. This lets you bind to the contents of the array from a view - for example, iterating over the array in the render function of a component.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byRefArray(MyNestedClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: [{x: 2}]}); // prop instanceof ObservableArray\n                                          // prop.at(0) instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                          // prop.at(0).x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});               // prop instanceof ObservableArray\n                                          // prop.length === 0\nIf you don't want the property to become an ObservableArray, but you still want each item in the array to be deserialized into an Exportable object, then pass in true as the second parameter (isStatic).\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byRefArray(MyNestedClass, true) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: [{x: 2}]}); // prop instanceof Array\n                                          // prop[0] instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                          // prop[0].x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});               // prop instanceof Array\n                                          // prop.length === 0\n@State.byCustomRefArray(getType, isStatic)\n@State.byCustomRefArray is the same as @State.byRefArray, except that you can choose the type of each element in the array dynamically. Just like @State.byCustomRef, you pass in a function that takes the JSON value as input - this lets you decide what class to use at the time fromJSON is called.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClassDebug {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\nvar getClass = function(jsonValue, object) {\n    return jsonValue.isDebug ? MyNestedClassDebug : MyNestedClass;\n};\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byCustomRefArray(getClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: [{x: 2}]});                // prop instanceof ObservableArray\n                                                         // prop.at(0) instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                                         // prop.at(0).x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: [{x: 2, isDebug: true}]}); // prop instanceof MyNestedClassDebug\n                                                         // prop.at(0).x === 2\nThe isStatic parameter works the same way as for @State.byRefArray.\n@State.byMap(isStatic)\nUse @State.byMap to deserialize JSON into an ObservableMap, where the value of each key is a primitive value (e.g. if you have a map onto strings or numbers). If each item in the array is a more complex object, consider using @State.byRefArray instead. This lets you bind to the contents of the array from a view - for example, iterating over the array in the render function of a component.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byMap prop;\n}\n\nvar map = { x: 2, y: 3 };\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: map}); // prop instanceof ObservableMap\n                                     // prop.get('x') === 2\n                                     // prop.get('y') === 3\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 42});  // prop instanceof ObservableMap\n                                     // prop.size === 0\nIf you want the property to become a normal object rather than an ObservableMap, pass in true as the second parameter (isStatic).\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byMap(true) prop;\n}\n\nvar map = { x: 2, y: 3 };\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: map}); // prop instanceof Object\n                                     // prop.x === 2\n                                     // prop.y === 3\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 42});  // prop instanceof Object\n                                     // Object.keys(prop).length === 0\n@State.byRefMap(type, isStatic)\nUse @State.byRefMap to deserialize JSON into an ObservableMap, where the value of each key is an instance of the class you pass in as a parameter. This is in contrast to @State.byMap, where the values are primitive types. This allows you to bind to the contents of the map from a view, so that the view updates when the key/value mapping can changes.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byRefMap(MyNestedClass) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {field: {x: 2} }}); // prop instanceof ObservableMap\n                                                 // prop.get('field') instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                                 // prop.get('field').x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});                      // prop instanceof ObservableMap\n                                                 // prop.size === 0\nIf you don't want the property to become an ObservableMap, but you still want each value in the map to be deserialized into an Exportable object, then pass in true as the second parameter (isStatic).\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyNestedClass {\n    @State.byVal x;\n}\n\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.byRefMap(MyNestedClass, true) prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: {field: {x: 2} }}); // prop instanceof Object\n                                                 // prop.field instanceof MyNestedClass\n                                                 // prop.field.x === 2\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({});                      // prop instanceof Object\n                                                 // Object.keys(prop).length === 0\n@State.alias(jsonName)\nUse @State.alias in conjunction with any other @State.XXX decorator, to use a different name for the property in JSON compared to the name of the property in the store. @State.alias takes the name to use when serializing to JSON as a parameter.\nExample:\n@Store\nclass MyClass {\n    @State.alias('jsonProp') @State.byVal prop;\n}\n\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({prop: 2});     // prop === undefined\nnew MyClass().fromJSON({jsonProp: 2}); // prop === 2\n"},"pages/reference/decorators/Store.html":{"url":"pages/reference/decorators/Store.html","title":"@Store","keywords":"","body":"@Store\nIndicates that the following class is a serializable store.

There are times, however, when you might want a store that permits mutations on fields directly — the most typical case is a form that is using bind: two-way data binding.\nTo indicate that a store should be mutable, the following can be used:\n@Store({mutable: true})\nclass MutableStore {\n    @State.byNumberVal n;\n}\n\nIf the store were immutable, writing something like mutableStore.n = 100 would throw an error.

Twist, however, allows the this attribute to be a string. This only makes sense for static inline styles as this can improve readability, but reduces the ability to directly target changes to specific styles later, unless you use targeted style extensions (explained below).\nFor example:\n{/* Typical React */}\n\n    Hello\n\n\n{/* Twist */}\n\n    Hello\n\n\nTargeted style extensions\nReact's requirement that the style attribute be an object can make it unnecessarily difficult to target individual styles. Components may often have several styles that never change, but may have one or two that do. Let's imagine a simple component that has a dynamically changing background.\n/* React */\nconst styles = {\n    container: {\n        borderWidth: 2,\n        borderStyle: 'solid',\n        padding: 5,\n        margin: 5,\n        width: 100,\n        height: 200\n    }\n};\n\nconst DynamicCard = ({backgroundColor = 'red', borderColor = 'black'} = {}) => (\n    \n);\n\n/*\n * if you can't use object spread, then you have to use\n * Object.assign({}, styles.container, { backgroundColor, borderColor })\n */\n\nAlthough this works, it can become difficult to read if a lot of styles are being modified.

This meant using className instead of class for assigning CSS classes. (class also happens to be a reserved word in JavaScript.)\nThis isn't terribly convenient, and it's error-prone. JSX looks so much like HTML that it's easy to fall back into HTML habits and simply write out class=\"foo\", and then spend several minutes wondering why styles aren't being applied correctly.\nTwist, however, allows you to use class when specifying class names, as shown in the following example:\n{/* React */}\n\n\n{/* Twist */}\n\n\nTwist adds a a couple of additional feature that makes it easier to work with multiple classes.

This allows you to create aliases for more complex expressions. It takes two attributes:\n\nvalue - the expression to evaluate.\nas - the variable to assign the expression to. Note that this must be a free identifier - if you try to write an expression, you'll get an error.\n\nHere's a simple example of , where we assign the expression this.name to the variable name:\n@Component\nexport default class Component {\n    @Observable name;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: \n            \n            \n                \n                    Hello { name }!\n                \n            \n        \n    }\n}\n\nNote that if the value expression evaluates to a falsy value (false, 0, null, undefined, '', NaN), then the contents of the  tag will not be rendered.\nIf you need to handle this case, an  component can be used after , like the following:\n@Component\nexport default class Component {\n    @Observable name;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            Name: \n            \n            \n                \n                    Hello { name }!\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Please enter your name.\n                \n            \n        \n    }\n}\n\nThe scope of the variable defined with as is limited to the contents of the  - you can't use it elsewhere in the JSX, so you get proper scoping. If you have a nested  that defines the same variable, then the innermost binding applies, as you'd expect:\nexport default \n    \n        Inner: { name }\n    ;\n    Outer: { name }\n;\n\nOne important use of  is to help with dynamically switching components - the only thing to remember is that custom components must start with an upper case letter. Here's an example:\n@Component\nclass MyButton {\n    render() {\n        return Button;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nclass MyTestButton {\n    render() {\n        return Test Button;\n    }\n}\n\n@Component\nexport default class MyComponent {\n    @Attribute isTest = false;\n\n    render() {\n        return \n            \n                \n            \n        ;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"pages/reference/middleware/":{"url":"pages/reference/middleware/","title":"Using Middleware","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nMiddleware\n\n\nMiddleware\nWhen you create a store, you can also pass in a middleware argument to the constructor.

A common mistake is to do something asynchronous, like a network call, or setting a timeout. The problem with this, is that it makes the changes to the store in response to an action non-deterministic. If you're using the DevTools Middleware, this poses a particular problem, because it needs to be able to replay synchronous actions as you move forwards and backwards in time.\nTo help detect such common mistakes, Twist comes with protector middleware that automatically blocks certain common asynchronous operations from inside of synchronous action handlers - for example, setTimeout, setInterval, and the use of promises. If you need to do something asynchronous, just make the action asynchronous (@Action({async: true}))! Since this has to replace some of the browser globals to achieve this, we recommend only using the protector middleware in your development environment / builds - not for production builds.\nTo use this middleware, just pass it in when creating your store:\nimport { protectorMiddleware } from '@twist/core';\n\nvar store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE, [protectorMiddleware]);\n\n"},"pages/reference/middleware/remoteDevMiddleware.html":{"url":"pages/reference/middleware/remoteDevMiddleware.html","title":"remoteDevMiddleware","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents  generated with DocToc\n\nDevTools Middleware\n\n\nDevTools Middleware\nRedux-devtools-extension is a browser plugin for Chrome/Firefox (and also Electron), that was built for debugging Redux applications. Twist comes bundled with middleware for connecting to this, so it's really easy to debug your store. Just pass in the middleware when creating your store:\nimport { remoteDevMiddleware } from '@twist/core';\n\nvar store = new MyStore(INITIAL_STATE, [remoteDevMiddleware]);\n\nIf you don't already have the browser plugin, you can install it from here.\nThe plugin records all the actions and changes to the state of your store, and lets you time travel to previous states, toggle actions, and do diffing on the state. This is all connected live to your application, so you can easily see how changes in the state get reflected in the view. You can also dispatch actions from the plugin, and save and restore the state, so you can pass it to somebody else, or include it in a bug report.\nWe recommend only using the remotedev middleware in your development environment / builds - not for production builds. This is because (a) you probably don't want your users to be able to debug your application, and (b) it adds a fair amount of overhead if the redux-devtools-extension is installed, since it records all changes to the state.\n"},"pages/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.html":{"url":"pages/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.html","title":"Acknowledgements","keywords":"","body":"Twist Acknowledgements\nTwist, and the libraries around Twist, evolved over a number of years at Adobe, and many people have contributed to it during this time.
